<h1><span class="header-section-number">7</span> Central Banks</h1>
<p>In managing our economy with disembedded measures of wealth,
the world’s central bankers are effectively agents of the sustainability crisis. They may not
wish to be unsustainable by personal inclination, but they certainly are by professional
obligation because of how they are duty-bound to act.
An entirely foreseeable response to the climate emergency is that people in wealthier
countries may choose to pare back their consumption of non-essentials. Certainly, not
everyone has the luxury to do this, but the obvious solution of “buying less stuff” has become
an articulated idea in wealthy countries. “Flight shaming” and “consumption shaming” are new
memes. Articles in multiple UK newspapers have challenged readers to see if they can go a
year without buying any new clothes, contravening the media’s normal practice of generally
trying to coax the economy along. (It buoys the advertising revenue).
Such behaviours would amount to a direct hit on GDP in developed countries, where personal
consumption can represent two-thirds of the total. Critically, any such reduction in
consumption will likely show up as a deflationary decline in economic activity that the world’s
central banks are on hair-trigger alert to prevent. The large and powerful financial
bureaucracy stands ready to provide immediate stimulus to any perceived flagging of
measured economic activity.
Hence, the arrangement most populations in the world currently live under is that should they
collectively choose to buy less, more money will be printed until they have changed their
mind. Effectively, our exhausted ecosystem is gasping for a lull in measured economic activity
that our financial authorities are pledged to never let happen.</p>

<div id="macroprudential" class="section level2" number="7.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Macroprudential</h2>
<p>Macroprudential policies are financial policies aimed at ensuring the stability of the financial system as a whole to prevent substantial disruptions in credit and other vital financial services necessary for stable economic growth. The stability of the financial system is at greater risk when financial vulnerabilities are high, such as when institutions and investors have high leverage and are overly reliant on uninsured short-term funding, and interconnections are complex and opaque. High vulnerabilities increase the likelihood that a firm’s failure or other negative shock would cause distress at other financial institutions because of direct exposures and through fire sales, contagion, or other negative externalities arising from the initial shock. Macroprudential policies aim to reduce the financial system’s sensitivity to shocks by limiting the buildup of financial vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>One example of a macroprudential policy is the higher capital charge applied to Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs), banks that pose more risk to the system. The G-SIB capital surcharge is based on five types of characteristics viewed to increase a bank’s systemic risk: size, complexity, interconnectedness, lack of substitutes, and cross-jurisdictional activity. Higher capital charges reduce the likelihood that a G-SIB would fail because they will have thicker capital cushions to absorb losses.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/understanding-the-effects-of-the-u-s-stress-tests/">recent paper</a> looks at how the macro scenarios and assumptions about dividends and share repurchases in the stress tests work to reduce procyclicality of capital requirements.</p>
<p>Macroprudential tools can be structural or cyclical. Structural policies are implemented to build lender or borrower resilience to adverse events at any point in the business cycle. For example, the additional capital charges for G-SIBs are a structural tool. In other countries, limits on loan-to-value ratios (LTVs) or debt service–to–income ratios (DSTIs) for mortgage borrowers are examples of structural tools that have been applied to borrowers. These limits can be macroprudential when they are intended to not only protect an individual borrower from too much debt, but to protect home values in neighborhoods from falling sharply because many borrowers have trouble making their payments at the same time. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, for example, sets the LTV ratios for borrowers based on the value of the property. Bank borrowers for properties with high values could get mortgages with LTV ratios ranging from 40 percent to 60 percent, while they could get mortgages with higher LTV ratios, up to 70 percent, for properties with low values.</p>
<p>Cyclical policies are aimed at increasing resilience in anticipation of an economic downturn to lessen the reduction in the supply of credit once the downturn materializes. The countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) is an example of a cyclical policy. The CCyB works by requiring banks to increase their capital cushions during an economic expansion when systemic risks are rising, and then release them in an economic downturn to absorb losses. Reducing the capital constraint by releasing the buffer when the economy slows helps to insure against deleveraging, which if not counteracted could deepen the downturn by restricting credit.</p>
<p>Historically, macroprudential policies have been used more often in emerging market economies than in advanced economies. But since the global financial crisis, both advanced economies and emerging market economies have been using macroprudential measures more frequently.</p>

<div id="central-bank-independence-1" class="section level2" number="7.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Central Bank Independence</h2>
<p><em>Haldane Memo</em></p>
<p>The widespread adoption of central bank independence was born out of the economic situation of the 1970s. The Great Inflation had seen high and persistent inflation across the world and economists turned their attention to the role that monetary policy played in this phenomenon. The time-consistency theory of Kydland and Prescott (1977), Nordhaus (1975) and Barro and Gordon (1983) provided an elegant answer to what might be going on. Governments had a natural tendency to over-inflate their economies, especially around election time, generating an “inflation bias.” To curb this inflation bias, some institutional means was needed to constrain government’s policy hand. Rogoff (1985) developed a model which provided such an institutional fix. Monetary policy decisions were to be delegated to a “conservative,” inflation-minded, central bank acting independently from government. In this way, central bank independence could prevent, at source, a return to the Great Inflation of the 1970s.</p>
<p>The macro-economic benefits, in theory, did not end there. Provided inflation expectations were well-anchored and central banks were not too inflation-averse – “inflation nutters” in the language of Mervyn King – monetary policy could be effective in stabilising output in the economy too. In other words, central bank independence was a potential twin-win, reducing inflation biases at no cost in increased output variability – a free lunch.</p>
<p>Empirical evidence followed to test these hypotheses. During the 1980s and 1990s, a number of papers established a statistically significant link between the level and variability of inflation and the degree of central bank independence across a range of countries. These cross-country correlations strongly suggested central independence was an important contributor to reduced inflation bias (Chart 3) and that it wasn’t associated with increased variability in output (Chart 4). The free lunch in theory was there in practice too. And this evidence, in turn, helped spur moves towards central bank independence in the latter-part of the 20th century.</p>
<p>Interestingly, a look at more recent time periods suggests these observed associations have vanished since the start of the 21st century (Charts 5-7). What explains this disappearing correlation? Some have used it to question whether the earlier link between independence and low inflation was no more than a statistical mirage. It could be argued that the fall in inflation over this earlier period was instead the result of the benign macro-economic environment of the Great Moderation. In other words, better inflation outcomes in the late 20th century might have reflected good luck rather than good central bank management.</p>
<p>The time-consistency problem familiar from monetary policy has a clear read-across to the world of financial stability. Governments have an incentive to run their financial systems, as well as their economies, hot in the interests of growth and electoral advantage. This generates a tendency to loosen regulation too far during credit booms, increasing the risk of future bouts of financial instability. In other words, there is a potential problem of “instability bias” in regulatory policies, to accompany the “inflation bias” in monetary policies.</p>
<p>In fact, I would argue this time-consistency problem is potentially greater in the financial stability sphere than for monetary policy, for two reasons. Credit cycles tend to be longer in duration, and larger in amplitude, than typical business cycles. This means wishful thinking and policy myopia (“this time is different”) are more likely to arise in credit booms than during typical business cycle upswings, exaggerating the time-consistency problem of financial stability policies.
The costs of financial instabilities and crises also tend to larger than the costs of inflationary surges. This means the temptation to act in a time-inconsistent fashion – talking tough ex-ante, but acting weak ex-post – also tends to be greater. That can encourage risk-taking and amplify financial cycles and crises – a doom loop. The Global Financial Crisis, a long-duration credit boom that prompted massive government support ex-post, was a good example of these acute financial stability time-consistency problems in practice.</p>
<p>Given the practical success of independence, it is important to guard it for the future. And there are potential threats here. Central banks around the world have expanded their balance sheets massively over the past decade, and particularly over the past year. While this is not monetary financing, it has blurred the line between the monetary and fiscal realms and, among some people, raised questions of independence. The test will come if and when inflation begins to rise and central banks need to tighten policy to meet their mandate, independently of the prevailing fiscal stance. At that point, the strength and effectiveness of the legal and institutional frameworks surrounding independence will be crucial in ensuring we continue to benefit from the twin-wins that have been a feature of the last few decades.</p>

<div id="market-neutrality" class="section level3" number="7.2.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">7.2.1</span> Market Neutrality</h3>
<p>The principle of market neutrality posits that corporate bonds purchased under the ECB’s €270bn corporate sector purchase programme should be made in a ‘neutral’ way: they should reflect the overall eligible market to ensure they do not distort the relative pricing of securities. Given the concentration of carbon-intensive industries in the corporate bond universe, this has resulted in a carbon-biased portfolio. This is problematic as it exposes the ECB to climate-related risks. And yet central bankers have so far been reluctant to question market neutrality for fear of losing their independence.</p>

<p><em>Klooster Abstract</em></p>
<p>Monetary policy operations in corporate security markets confront central
banks with choices that are traditionally perceived to be the prerogative of
governments. This article investigates how central bankers legitimise
corporate security purchases through a comparative study of the
European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). As we
show, central bankers downplay the novelty of corporate security
purchases by relying on familiar pre-crisis justifications of Central Bank
Independence. Citing an ideal of ‘market neutrality,’ central banks
present corporate security purchases as pursuing a narrow objective of
price stability and obfuscate their distributive consequences. In this way,
central bankers depoliticise corporate security purchases: they reduce
the potential for choice, collective agency, and deliberation concerning
both the pursuit of corporate security purchases and the choices made
in implementing these policies. We also describe the undesirable
democratic, social and environmental dimensions of these practices,
which we propose to address through enhanced democratic
accountability.</p>
<p><em>Klooster Memo</em></p>
<p>The past decades saw central banks acquire considerable independence from democratic institutions
(McNamara 2002, Singleton 2010). Governments justified their decision to delegate monetary policy
by relying on a narrow conception of monetary policy. This conception focuses on the setting of short
term interest rates to achieve a long-term objective of stable price levels. A crucial element in the
justification of central bank independence is the idea that monetary policy is an apolitical, technical
area of policymaking (Marcussen 2009). The loss of democratic control that results from the creation
of an independent central bank was also thought to be minimal, because distributive choices would
remain with elected governments, who both decided on the central bank mandate and retained the
use of fiscal instruments to achieve their distributive objectives. In this way, governments depoliticised
monetary policy in the sense of reducing the potential for choice, collective agency, and deliberation
around the use of monetary policy</p>
<p>The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) led central bankers to move far beyond the narrow task assigned
to them under the traditional justification of Central Bank Independence (CBI)
To rescue a global financial system on the brink of collapse, central bankers assumed new roles as lenders and market makers of last resort.</p>
<p>Central bankers, meanwhile, are openly concerned that the use of unconventional tools threatens
their independence.
When independent regulatory agencies extend their power, political authorities often seek to regain
control.
Central bankers, accordingly, try to counteract repoliticisation and these efforts
shape their policies.</p>
<p>To investigate the simultaneously occurring processes of politicisation and depoliticisation
we investigate how central bankers relate to the political dimensions of their
new unconventional policies.</p>
<p>QE increases wealth inequalities.</p>
<p>Central bankers depoliticise their security purchases by subsuming
them under the pre-crisis justification of CBI.</p>
<p>Central bankers present themselves as pursuing price stability,
while in reality engaging in these purchases for reasons that are entirely unrelated to price stability.</p>
<p><em>‘Market Neutrality’</em></p>
<p>Rather than acknowledging and
managing the market impact of their policies, central bankers pursue ‘market neutrality,’ e.g. they
seek to minimise the impact of their purchases on the relative prices of financial assets.</p>
<p>Central bankers keep decisions on new monetary instruments in the domain of their
expert judgment, and thereby outside the domain of democratic politics.</p>
<p>As a consequence of their effort to make corporate security purchases market neutral,
these programmes are insufficiently sensitive to environmental and societal concerns.</p>
<p>Depoliticisation of monetary policy: First, independent
central banks treat monetary policy as having a narrow objective, which can be achieved with a
clearly-defined toolbox and, second, central bankers treat distributive consequences as insignificant
and sanctioned by the central bank’s mandate.</p>

<p>The new exogenous money is exogenous transition shocks in the climate change debate.
Fortunately, Bank of England cannot hide behind that rock because of their new climate mandate.</p>
<p>Remember, Mark Carney’s ‘tragedy of the horizons’ speech identified two main risks of climate crisis:
- physical risks (climate events)
- transition risks - from green policies to accelerate transition to low-carbon</p>
<p>Now, central banks are confronted with an unpleasant conundrum that reveals the deeply political nature of their operations:
greening monetary policy (collateral, unconventional bond purchases) means endogenous transition risks</p>
<p>So, in a have your cake and eat it moment, there is a growing tendency in central bank communities to pretend that all transition risks come from the fiscal side (carbon pricing)</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be surprising to find the exogenous transition shocks approach in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy review, despite <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lagarde" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Lagarde?</strong></a>)</span>
and other’s recognition that central banks cannot longer hide behind the ‘market neutrality’ argument.</p>

<p><strong>BIS Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>This report provides an overview of conceptual issues related to climate-related financial risk
measurement and methodologies, as well as practical implementation by banks and supervisors.</p>
<p>The report contains five key findings:
First, climate-related financial risks have unique features, necessitating granular and
forward-looking measurement methodologies.</p>
<p>Second, to date, measurement of climate-related financial risks by banks and supervisors
has centred on mapping near-term transition risk drivers into counterparty and portfolio exposures.</p>
<p>Third, banks and supervisors have predominantly focused on assessing credit risk, as they
advance in applying methods to translate climate-related exposures into categories of financial risk.</p>
<p>Fourth, while banks and supervisors remain at an early stage of translating climate-related
risks into robustly quantifiable financial risk, work continues to gather pace</p>
<p>Fifth, key areas for future analytical exploration relate to measurement gaps in data and
risk classification methods, as well as methodologies suitable for assessing long-term climate
phenomena not always of a standard nature.</p>

<p><strong>Institutional Dynamics</strong></p>
<p><em>Baer Abstract</em></p>
<p>This article studies how institutional dynamics might affect the implementation of climate-
related financial policies. First, we propose a three-dimensional framework to distinguish: i)
motives for policy implementation (prudential or promotional); ii) policy instruments
(informational, incentive or coercive); and iii) implementing authorities (political or
delegated). Second, we use this framework to show how sustainable financial interventions in
certain jurisdictions - most notably, Europe - rely solely on informational policies to achieve
both promotional and prudential objectives. Policymakers in other jurisdictions - e.g., China -
also implement incentive or coercive financial policies to achieve promotional objectives.
Third, we identify two main institutional explanations for this European ‘promotional gap’: i)
limited control of political authorities on financial dynamics; and ii) strong powers and
independence of delegated authorities. This governance configuration leads to an institutional
deadlock in which only measures fitting with both political and delegated authorities’
objectives can be implemented. Finally, we discuss the scenarios that might originate from the
current institutional setting. We identify three possible evolutionary paths: i) a drift towards a
green financial technocracy; ii) a re-politicization of delegated authorities; iii) a move towards
fiscal-monetary coordination.</p>
<p><em>Baer Memo</em></p>
<p>In 2017, the EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis expressed his support to the idea of
introducing a ‘green supporting factor’ in bank capital requirements to incentivize lending to
sustainable activities (Dombrovskis, 2017). The following year, the European Commission
included the idea of ‘incorporating sustainability in prudential requirements’ in its sustainable
finance action plan (EC, 2018). This position was generally greeted with skepticism by most
central bankers and financial supervisors (see, among others: Dankert et al., 2018; Elderson,
2018; Rehn, 2018). It was emphasized that the aim of prudential rules is to mitigate financial
risk, not to steer private credit in any particular direction. <em>According to central bankers and
financial supervisors, capital requirements should not discriminate between green and dirty
financial assets, unless clear evidence of risk differentials is available.</em></p>
<p>This recent clash between public institutions raises deeper questions. For what purposes should
banking and financial regulation be used? And who should decide what the admissible
purposes are?</p>
<p>EU Banking regulation cannot be employed as a
policy tool to actively reallocate private financial resources towards sustainable investments.</p>
<p>In several emerging economies banking and financial regulation is instead
actively used to promote specific productive sectors.
Financial risk is still monitored, but stronger
weight is given to development (e.g., green) objectives.</p>
<p>The current status quo is unsustainable due to environmental constraints. At some
point, someone will need to introduce stronger promotional policies to steer credit towards
sustainable sectors. Given the distribution of responsibilities, missions, and powers crystallized
within the current institutional framework, these promotional efforts should be led by the
political authorities, leaving delegated authorities with a supporting role.</p>

<p><em>Stellinga Abstract</em></p>
<p>The 2007–09 financial crisis appeared to demonstrate the need for a strong, supranational EU macro‐prudential policy framework to prevent similar future disasters. The implemented framework, however, is neither. It is highly complex, involving many constraints on the use of macro‐prudential instruments. It is also one of the principal areas of national discretion in EU banking regulation. To explain this, I build on the ‘financial trilemma’ thesis which holds that there are inherent tensions between pursuing financial stability, financial integration and national financial policies. Supranationalizing macro‐prudential policy proved difficult due to a lack of consensus on how to measure systemic risks and because of the distributional consequences involved. This increased the tension between stability and integration, as national macro‐prudential policies could constrain cross‐border finance and they could be misused for competitiveness considerations. Key policy actors disagreed on which goals to prioritize, with bargaining leading to a convoluted policy framework.</p>
<p><em>Stellinga Memo</em></p>
<p>MPP targets systemic risks by enabling supervisors to tighten requirements during booms, to loosen them when risks recede, and to impose tougher rules on systemically important financial institutions.</p>
<p>Given the devastating consequences of the crisis and EU policy‐makers’ embrace of macro‐prudential ideas, a strong MPP framework seemed a likely post‐crisis outcome. Especially in light of the EU’s push for regulatory harmonization – both the single rulebook and the shift (in the Eurozone) towards supranational supervision by the European Central Bank (ECB) reduced national discretion in micro‐prudential regulation – we would have expected a harmonized framework to emerge for macro‐prudential policy.</p>
<p>The implemented framework did not meet these expectations.
Although supervisors gained new macro‐prudential instruments, their use has been constrained by procedural requirements and limits to their stringency and scope, with macro‐prudential instruments focusing on capital requirements and leaving other segments of banking regulation and the non‐banking sector largely untouched.</p>
<p>Systemic risk is an elusive concept with an important national dimension, rendering a one‐size‐fits‐all approach counterproductive.</p>
<p>The MPP framework that developed between 2009 and 13 was the result of key actors’ inability to agree on how to balance national discretion, stability and integration.</p>
<p>With no consensus on how to measure systemic risks, supranational macro‐prudential norms implied a one‐size‐fits‐none approach. As systemic risks change over time, relying on a fixed set of indicators could well mean preparing for yesterday’s war.</p>
