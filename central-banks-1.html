<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Central Banks</h1>
<p>In managing our economy with disembedded measures of wealth,
the world’s central bankers are effectively agents of the sustainability crisis. They may not
wish to be unsustainable by personal inclination, but they certainly are by professional
obligation because of how they are duty-bound to act.
An entirely foreseeable response to the climate emergency is that people in wealthier
countries may choose to pare back their consumption of non-essentials. Certainly, not
everyone has the luxury to do this, but the obvious solution of “buying less stuff” has become
an articulated idea in wealthy countries. “Flight shaming” and “consumption shaming” are new
memes. Articles in multiple UK newspapers have challenged readers to see if they can go a
year without buying any new clothes, contravening the media’s normal practice of generally
trying to coax the economy along. (It buoys the advertising revenue).
Such behaviours would amount to a direct hit on GDP in developed countries, where personal
consumption can represent two-thirds of the total. Critically, any such reduction in
consumption will likely show up as a deflationary decline in economic activity that the world’s
central banks are on hair-trigger alert to prevent. The large and powerful financial
bureaucracy stands ready to provide immediate stimulus to any perceived flagging of
measured economic activity.
Hence, the arrangement most populations in the world currently live under is that should they
collectively choose to buy less, more money will be printed until they have changed their
mind. Effectively, our exhausted ecosystem is gasping for a lull in measured economic activity
that our financial authorities are pledged to never let happen.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.1.1</span> Market Neutrality</h3>
<p>The principle of market neutrality posits that corporate bonds purchased under the ECB’s €270bn corporate sector purchase programme should be made in a ‘neutral’ way: they should reflect the overall eligible market to ensure they do not distort the relative pricing of securities. Given the concentration of carbon-intensive industries in the corporate bond universe, this has resulted in a carbon-biased portfolio. This is problematic as it exposes the ECB to climate-related risks. And yet central bankers have so far been reluctant to question market neutrality for fear of losing their independence.</p>

<p><em>Klooster Abstract</em></p>
<p>Monetary policy operations in corporate security markets confront central
banks with choices that are traditionally perceived to be the prerogative of
governments. This article investigates how central bankers legitimise
corporate security purchases through a comparative study of the
European Central Bank (ECB) and the Swiss National Bank (SNB). As we
show, central bankers downplay the novelty of corporate security
purchases by relying on familiar pre-crisis justifications of Central Bank
Independence. Citing an ideal of ‘market neutrality,’ central banks
present corporate security purchases as pursuing a narrow objective of
price stability and obfuscate their distributive consequences. In this way,
central bankers depoliticise corporate security purchases: they reduce
the potential for choice, collective agency, and deliberation concerning
both the pursuit of corporate security purchases and the choices made
in implementing these policies. We also describe the undesirable
democratic, social and environmental dimensions of these practices,
which we propose to address through enhanced democratic
accountability.</p>
<p><em>Klooster Memo</em></p>
<p>The past decades saw central banks acquire considerable independence from democratic institutions
(McNamara 2002, Singleton 2010). Governments justified their decision to delegate monetary policy
by relying on a narrow conception of monetary policy. This conception focuses on the setting of short
term interest rates to achieve a long-term objective of stable price levels. A crucial element in the
justification of central bank independence is the idea that monetary policy is an apolitical, technical
area of policymaking (Marcussen 2009). The loss of democratic control that results from the creation
of an independent central bank was also thought to be minimal, because distributive choices would
remain with elected governments, who both decided on the central bank mandate and retained the
use of fiscal instruments to achieve their distributive objectives. In this way, governments depoliticised
monetary policy in the sense of reducing the potential for choice, collective agency, and deliberation
around the use of monetary policy</p>
<p>The Global Financial Crisis (GFC) led central bankers to move far beyond the narrow task assigned
to them under the traditional justification of Central Bank Independence (CBI)
To rescue a global financial system on the brink of collapse, central bankers assumed new roles as lenders and market makers of last resort.</p>
<p>Central bankers, meanwhile, are openly concerned that the use of unconventional tools threatens
their independence.
When independent regulatory agencies extend their power, political authorities often seek to regain
control.
Central bankers, accordingly, try to counteract repoliticisation and these efforts
shape their policies.</p>
<p>To investigate the simultaneously occurring processes of politicisation and depoliticisation
we investigate how central bankers relate to the political dimensions of their
new unconventional policies.</p>
<p>QE increases wealth inequalities.</p>
<p>Central bankers depoliticise their security purchases by subsuming
them under the pre-crisis justification of CBI.</p>
<p>Central bankers present themselves as pursuing price stability,
while in reality engaging in these purchases for reasons that are entirely unrelated to price stability.</p>
<p><em>‘Market Neutrality’</em></p>
<p>Rather than acknowledging and
managing the market impact of their policies, central bankers pursue ‘market neutrality,’ e.g. they
seek to minimise the impact of their purchases on the relative prices of financial assets.</p>
<p>Central bankers keep decisions on new monetary instruments in the domain of their
expert judgment, and thereby outside the domain of democratic politics.</p>
<p>As a consequence of their effort to make corporate security purchases market neutral,
these programmes are insufficiently sensitive to environmental and societal concerns.</p>
<p>Depoliticisation of monetary policy: First, independent
central banks treat monetary policy as having a narrow objective, which can be achieved with a
clearly-defined toolbox and, second, central bankers treat distributive consequences as insignificant
and sanctioned by the central bank’s mandate.</p>

<p>The new exogenous money is exogenous transition shocks in the climate change debate.
Fortunately, Bank of England cannot hide behind that rock because of their new climate mandate.</p>
<p>Remember, Mark Carney’s ‘tragedy of the horizons’ speech identified two main risks of climate crisis:
- physical risks (climate events)
- transition risks - from green policies to accelerate transition to low-carbon</p>
<p>Now, central banks are confronted with an unpleasant conundrum that reveals the deeply political nature of their operations:
greening monetary policy (collateral, unconventional bond purchases) means endogenous transition risks</p>
<p>So, in a have your cake and eat it moment, there is a growing tendency in central bank communities to pretend that all transition risks come from the fiscal side (carbon pricing)</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be surprising to find the exogenous transition shocks approach in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy review, despite <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Lagarde" role="doc-biblioref"><strong>Lagarde?</strong></a>)</span>
and other’s recognition that central banks cannot longer hide behind the ‘market neutrality’ argument.</p>

<p><strong>BIS Recommendations</strong></p>
<p>This report provides an overview of conceptual issues related to climate-related financial risk
measurement and methodologies, as well as practical implementation by banks and supervisors.</p>
<p>The report contains five key findings:
First, climate-related financial risks have unique features, necessitating granular and
forward-looking measurement methodologies.</p>
<p>Second, to date, measurement of climate-related financial risks by banks and supervisors
has centred on mapping near-term transition risk drivers into counterparty and portfolio exposures.</p>
<p>Third, banks and supervisors have predominantly focused on assessing credit risk, as they
advance in applying methods to translate climate-related exposures into categories of financial risk.</p>
<p>Fourth, while banks and supervisors remain at an early stage of translating climate-related
risks into robustly quantifiable financial risk, work continues to gather pace</p>
<p>Fifth, key areas for future analytical exploration relate to measurement gaps in data and
risk classification methods, as well as methodologies suitable for assessing long-term climate
phenomena not always of a standard nature.</p>

<p><strong>Institutional Dynamics</strong></p>
<p><em>Baer Abstract</em></p>
<p>This article studies how institutional dynamics might affect the implementation of climate-
related financial policies. First, we propose a three-dimensional framework to distinguish: i)
motives for policy implementation (prudential or promotional); ii) policy instruments
(informational, incentive or coercive); and iii) implementing authorities (political or
delegated). Second, we use this framework to show how sustainable financial interventions in
certain jurisdictions - most notably, Europe - rely solely on informational policies to achieve
both promotional and prudential objectives. Policymakers in other jurisdictions - e.g., China -
also implement incentive or coercive financial policies to achieve promotional objectives.
Third, we identify two main institutional explanations for this European ‘promotional gap’: i)
limited control of political authorities on financial dynamics; and ii) strong powers and
independence of delegated authorities. This governance configuration leads to an institutional
deadlock in which only measures fitting with both political and delegated authorities’
objectives can be implemented. Finally, we discuss the scenarios that might originate from the
current institutional setting. We identify three possible evolutionary paths: i) a drift towards a
green financial technocracy; ii) a re-politicization of delegated authorities; iii) a move towards
fiscal-monetary coordination.</p>
<p><em>Baer Memo</em></p>
<p>In 2017, the EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis expressed his support to the idea of
introducing a ‘green supporting factor’ in bank capital requirements to incentivize lending to
sustainable activities (Dombrovskis, 2017). The following year, the European Commission
included the idea of ‘incorporating sustainability in prudential requirements’ in its sustainable
finance action plan (EC, 2018). This position was generally greeted with skepticism by most
central bankers and financial supervisors (see, among others: Dankert et al., 2018; Elderson,
2018; Rehn, 2018). It was emphasized that the aim of prudential rules is to mitigate financial
risk, not to steer private credit in any particular direction. <em>According to central bankers and
financial supervisors, capital requirements should not discriminate between green and dirty
financial assets, unless clear evidence of risk differentials is available.</em></p>
<p>This recent clash between public institutions raises deeper questions. For what purposes should
banking and financial regulation be used? And who should decide what the admissible
purposes are?</p>
<p>EU Banking regulation cannot be employed as a
policy tool to actively reallocate private financial resources towards sustainable investments.</p>
<p>In several emerging economies banking and financial regulation is instead
actively used to promote specific productive sectors.
Financial risk is still monitored, but stronger
weight is given to development (e.g., green) objectives.</p>
<p>The current status quo is unsustainable due to environmental constraints. At some
point, someone will need to introduce stronger promotional policies to steer credit towards
sustainable sectors. Given the distribution of responsibilities, missions, and powers crystallized
within the current institutional framework, these promotional efforts should be led by the
political authorities, leaving delegated authorities with a supporting role.</p>
