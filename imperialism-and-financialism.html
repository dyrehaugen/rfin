<h1><span class="header-section-number">9</span> Imperialism and Financialism</h1>
<p><em>Bichler &amp; Nitzan</em></p>
<p>Over the past century, the nexus of imperialism and financialism has become a major axis
of Marxist theory and praxis. Many Marxists consider this nexus to be a cause of worldy
ills, but the historical role they ascribe to it has changed dramatically over time. The key
change concerns the nature and direction of surplus and liquidity flows. The first
incarnation of the nexus, articulated at the turn of the twentieth century, explained the
imperialist scramble for colonies to which finance capital could export its ‘excessive’
surplus. The next version posited a neo-imperial world of monopoly capitalism where the
core’s surplus is absorbed domestically, sucked into a ‘black hole’ of military spending
and financial intermediation. The third script postulated a World System where surplus is
imported from the dependent periphery into the financial core. And the most recent
edition explains the hollowing out of the U.S. core, a ‘red giant’ that has already burned
much of its own productive fuel and is now trying to ‘financialize’ the rest of the world in
order to use the system’s external liquidity. This paper outlines this chameleon-like
transformation, assesses what is left of the nexus and asks whether it is worth keeping.</p>
<p>Our aim is to highlight the historical development of the
nexus of imperialism and financialism,
particularly the loose manner in which it has been altered –
to the point of meaning everything and nothing.</p>
<p>The paper comprises two parts. The first part examines the different schools. It
traces the transmutation of the nexus – from its first articulation in the early twentieth
century, to the version developed by the Monopoly Capital school, to the arguments of
dependency and Word Systems analyses, to the thesis of hegemonic transition. The
second part offers an empirical exploration. Focusing specifically on the hegemonic
transition hypothesis, it identifies difficulties that arise when the theory meets the
evidence and assesses their significance for the century-old nexus.</p>
<p><strong>Empire and Finance</strong></p>
<p>The centralization of capital altered the political landscape. Instead of
the night-watchman government of the laissez-faire epoch, there emerged a strong, active
state.
The laissez-faire capitalists of the earlier era saw little reason to share their profits
with the state and therefore glorified the frugality of a small central administration and
minimal taxation. But the new state was no longer run by hands-off liberals. Instead, it was
dominated and manipulated by an aggressive oligarchy of ‘finance capital’ – a coalition of
large bankers, leading industrialists, war mongers and speculators who needed a strong
state that would crack down on domestic opposition and embark on foreign military
adventures.</p>
<p>The concentrated financialized economy, went the argument, requires pre-capitalist colonies
where surplus capital can be invested profitably; and the cabal of finance capital, now in
the political driver’s seat, is able to push the state into an international imperialist
struggle to obtain those colonies.</p>
<p>At the time, this thesis was not only totally new and highly sophisticated; it also
fit closely with the unfolding of events. It gave an elegant explanation for the imperial
bellicosity of the late nineteenth century, and it neatly accounted for the circumstances
leading to the great imperial conflict of the first ‘World War.’</p>
<p><strong>Monopoly Capital</strong></p>
<p>In the brave new world of oligopolies, the emphasis on non-price competition
speeds up the pace of technical change and efficiency gains, making commodities cheaper
and cheaper to produce. But unlike in a competitive system, where market discipline
forces firms to pass on their lower costs to consumers, under the new circumstances, cost
reductions do not translate into falling prices. The prevalence of oligopolies creates a
built-in inflationary bias that, despite falling costs, makes prices move up and sometimes
sideways, but rarely if ever down.</p>
<p>This growing divergence between falling costs and rising prices increases the
income share of capitalists, and that increase reverses the underlying course of capitalism.
Marx believed that the combination of ever-growing mechanization and ruthless
competition creates a tendency of the rate of profit to fall. But the substitution of
monopoly capitalism for free competition inverts the trajectory. The new system
is ruled by an opposite ‘tendency of the surplus to rise.’</p>
<p>The early theorists of imperialism, although using a different vocabulary,
understood the gist of this transformation. And even though they did not provide a full
theory to explain it, they realized that the consequence of that transformation was to shift
the problem of capitalism from production to circulation (or in later Keynesian parlance,
from ‘aggregate supply’ to ‘aggregate demand’). The new capitalism, they pointed out,
suffered not from insufficient surplus, but from too much surplus, and its key challenge
now was how to ‘offset’ and ‘absorb’ this ever-growing excess so that accumulation could
keep going instead of coming to a halt.</p>
<p><strong>Black Hole: The Role of Institutionalized Waste</strong></p>
<p>Until the early twentieth century, it seemed that the only way to offset the growing excess
was productive and external: the surplus of goods and capital had to be exported to and
productively invested in pre-capitalist colonies. But as it turned out, there was another
solution, one that the early theorists hadn’t foreseen and that the analysts of Monopoly
Capital now emphasized. The surplus could also be disposed off unproductively and
internally: it could be wasted at home.</p>
<p>‘Waste’ denoted expenditures that are
necessary neither for producing the surplus nor for reproducing the population, and that
are, in that sense, totally unproductive and therefore wasteful. These expenditures absorb
existing surplus without creating any new surplus, and this double feature enables them to
mitigate without aggravating the tendency of the surplus to rise.</p>
<p>Use high military spending as a way to
secure the internal stability of U.S. capitalism.</p>
<p>The magnitude of military expenditures has no obvious ceiling: it
depends solely on the ability of the ruling class to justify the expenditures on the grounds
of national security. Similarly with the size of the financial sector: its magnitude expands
with the potentially limitless inflation of credit. This convenient expandability turns
military spending and financial intermediation into a giant ‘black hole.’</p>
<p>Spearheaded by U.S.-based multinationals and no longer hindered by inter-
capitalist wars, argued the theorists, the new order of monopoly capitalism has become
increasingly global and ever more integrated. And this global integration, they continued,
has come to depend on an international division of labour, free access to strategic raw
materials and political regimes that are ideologically open for business. However, these
conditions do not develop automatically and peacefully. They have to be actively
promoted and enforced.</p>
<p>Military spending comes to serve a dual role: together with the
financial sector and other forms of waste, it propels the accumulation of capital by black-
holing a large chunk of the economic surplus; and it helps secure a more sophisticated
and effective neo-imperial order that no longer needs colonial territories but is every bit
as expansionary, exploitative and violent as its crude imperial predecessor.</p>
<p><strong>Dependency</strong></p>
<p>The imperial powers relentlessly and systematically
undermined the socio-economic fabric of the periphery, making it totally dependent on
the core. And when decolonization finally started, the periphery found itself unable to
take off while the capitalist core prospered.
At that
point, there was no longer any need for core states to openly colonize and export capital
to the periphery. Using their disproportionate economic and state power, the former
imperialist countries were now able to hold the postcolonial periphery in a state of
debilitating economic monoculture, political submissiveness and cultural backwardness
– and, wherever they could, to impose on it a system of unequal exchange.</p>
<p>This logic of dependent underdevelopment was first articulated during the
1950s and 1960s as an antidote to the liberal modernization thesis and its Rostowian
promise of an imminent takeoff.</p>
<p>Whereas earlier Marxist
theorists of imperialism accentuated the centrality of exploitation in production,
dependency and World-Systems analysts shifted the focus to trade and unequal
exchange. And while previous theories concentrated on the global class struggle,
dependency and World-Systems analyses spoke of a conflict between states and
geographical regions.</p>
<p><strong>Red Giant: An Empire Imploded</strong></p>
<p>‘Financialization’ is no longer a panacea for the
imperial power. On the contrary, it is a ‘sign of autumn,’ prime evidence of imperial
decline.</p>
<p>Finance (along with other
forms of waste) helps the imperial core absorb its rising surplus – and in so doing
prevents stagnation and keeps accumulation going. But there is a price to pay. The
addiction to financial waste ends up consuming the very fuel that sustains the core’s
imperial position: it hollows out the core’s industrial sector, it undermines its productive
vitality, and, eventually, it limits its military capabilities. The financial sector itself
continues to expand absolutely and relatively, but this is the expansion of a ‘red giant’ –
the final inflation of a star ready to implode.</p>
<p>The process leading to this implosion is emphasized by theories of hegemonic
transition.</p>
<p>The maturation of a hegemonic power – be it Holland in the
seventeenth century, Britain in the nineteenth century or the United States presently –
coincides with the ‘over-accumulation’ of capital.</p>
<p>This over-accumulation – along with growing international rivalries,
challenges and conflicts – triggers a system-wide financial expansion marked by soaring
capital flows, a rise in market speculation and a general inflation of debt and equity
values.
The financial expansion itself is led by the hegemonic state in an attempt to
arrest its own decline, but the reprieve it offers can only be temporary. Relying on finance
drains the core of its energy, causes productive investment to flow elsewhere and
eventually sets in motion the imminent process of hegemonic transition.</p>
<p>The United States benefited from being able to control,
manipulate and leverage this expansion for its own ends.
The growing severity of recent financial, economic and military crises suggests
that this ability has been greatly reduced and that U.S. hegemony is now coming to an end.</p>
<p><strong>End of Nexus?</strong></p>
<p>‘Financialization’ has not worked for the hegemonic power: despite the alleged
omnipotence of its Wall Street-Washington Complex, despite its control over key
international organizations, despite having imposed neoliberalism on the rest of the
world, and despite its seemingly limitless ability to borrow funds and suck in global
liquidity – the bottom line is that the net profit share of U.S.-listed corporations has kept
falling and falling.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the first time that a monkey wrench has been thrown into the wheels
of the ever-changing nexus of imperialism and financialism. As we have seen, over the past
century the nexus has had to be repeatedly altered and transformed to match the
changing reality. Its first incarnation explained the imperialist scramble for colonies to
which finance capital could export its ‘excessive’ surplus. The next version talked of a neo-
imperial world of monopoly capitalism where the core’s surplus is absorbed domestically,
sucked into a ‘black hole’ of military spending and financial intermediation. The third
script postulated a World System where surplus is imported from the dependent
periphery into the financial core. And the most recent edition explains the hollowing out
of the U.S. core, a ‘red giant’ that has already burned much of its own productive fuel and
is now trying to ‘financialize’ the rest of the world in order to use the system’s external
liquidity.
Yet, here, too, the facts refuse to cooperate: contrary to the theory, they suggest
that the U.S. ‘Empire’ has followed rather than led the global process of ‘financialization,’
and that U.S. capitalists have consistently been less dependent on finance than their peers
elsewhere.</p>
